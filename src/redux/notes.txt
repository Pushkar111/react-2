Problem :- I need to transfer or pass gState in F Component or D or E Component so i have to put it that gState in A Component 
------- :- So this is known as props drilling 
        :- to overcome this Problem The Redux will use



                                        A
                                        |
                    -----------------------------------------
                    |                                       |
                    B                                       C
                    |                                       |
        -------------------------               -------------------------
        |                       |               |                       |
        D                       E               F                       G (gState{...})



Solution :- Redux ---> State Management Library
--------


Redux Terminologies :- 
-------------------

    1) Redux Store :- use context api in backend
        -> Contains 3 Parts 
            1. Application State
                    state : {
                        gState: {...},
                        fState: {...},
                        eState: {...},
                        dState: {...},
                    }


            2. State Update Logic
                    function reducer(){}

            3. Method to notify State Change
                    subscribe()
                    

Q. What Redux Will do ? 
-> Redux will manage the state centrally in a store, 
-> allowing any component to access the state directly without the need for props drilling. 
-> This is achieved by connecting components to the Redux store using the `connect` function or the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks in functional components.
-> This way, components can read from and dispatch actions to the store, ensuring a single source of truth for the application state.
